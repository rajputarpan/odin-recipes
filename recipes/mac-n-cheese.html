    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is incredibly easy, and your kids would probably love to help you make it! I let my littles help grate the cheese and measure the noodles.</p>
    
    <p>This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stove-top, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Macaroni</li>
        <li>Butter</li>

        <li>Seasonings</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the noodles: </strong>Boil the macaroni in salted water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese sauce: </strong>Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the topping: </strong>Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the mac and cheese: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown.</li>
